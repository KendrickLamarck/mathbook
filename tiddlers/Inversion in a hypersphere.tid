title: Inversion in a hypersphere
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//Reflection// or //inversion// in a hypersphere with center $$c$$ and radius $$r$$ is the map

$$
x\mapsto c+\frac{r^2}{\|x-c\|^2}(x-c).
$$

This maps a point $$x$$ inside or outside the hypersphere along the ray through $$c$$ and $$x$$ to the point $$x'$$ such that

$$
\|x-c\|\cdot\|x'-c\|=r^2.
$$

If we consider $$\widehat\Bbb R^n\coloneqq\Bbb R^n\cup\{\infty\}$$ and map $$c$$ to $$\infty$$ and vice versa, this map is an [[involution|Involution]] of $$\widehat\Bbb R^n.$$
