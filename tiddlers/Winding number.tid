Suppose $$\gamma\colon \sphere^1 \to \R^2$$ is an oriented closed curve with $$p \notin \gamma(\sphere^1).$$ Radial projection $$\pi_p$$ around $$p$$ can be viewed as a deformation retraction $$\R^2 \setminus \{p\} \cong \sphere^1 \to \sphere^1,$$ so we define the //winding number// of $$\gamma$$ around $$p$$ to be
$$
W(\gamma,p) \coloneqq \deg(\pi_p \circ \gamma).
