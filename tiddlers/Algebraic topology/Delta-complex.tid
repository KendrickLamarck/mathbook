A //$$\Delta$$-complex// structure on $$X$$ is a collection of maps $$\sigma_\alpha \colon \Delta^n \to X$$ defined on [[simplices|Simplex]] ($$n$$ is dependent on $$\alpha$$) such that

* each restriction to an open simplex $$\sigma_\alpha|_{\mathring\Delta^n}$$ is injective,
* the //open cells// $$e_\alpha^n \coloneqq \sigma_\alpha(\mathring\Delta^n)$$ partition $$X,$$
* the restriction of $$\sigma_\alpha$$ to any face of $$\Delta^n$$ (composed with the standard linear map from $$\Delta^k$$ to that face) is one of our maps $$\sigma_\beta,$$
* $$U \subseteq X$$ is open if and only if each $$\sigma_\alpha{}^{-1}(U)$$ is open in $$\Delta^n.$$

A $$\Delta$$-complex is called //regular// if each $$\sigma_\alpha$$ is injective even on the boundary.
