title: General position (projective space)

Let $$\mathrm P(V)$$ be an $$n$$-dimensional [[projective space|Projective space]]. Then $$n+2$$ points in $$\mathrm P(V)$$ are said to be in //general position,// if no $$n+1$$ of the points are contained in an $$n-1$$-dimensional [[projective subspace|Projective subspace]]. Equivalently, any $$n+1$$ of the points have [[linearly independent|Lineare Unabh√§ngigkeit]] representative vectors.

''Technical Lemma.''
Let $$\mathrm P(V)$$ be an $$n$$-dimensional projective space and suppose $$P_1,\dots,P_{n+2}\in \mathrm P(V)$$ are in general position. Then representative vectors $$v_1,\dots,v_{n+2}\in V$$ may be chosen so that $$P_j=[v_j]$$ and

$$
v_1+\dots+v_{n+2}=0.
$$

This choice of representative vectors is unique up to a common scaling factor.
