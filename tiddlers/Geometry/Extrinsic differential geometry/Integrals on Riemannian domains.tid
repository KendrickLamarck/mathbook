title: Integrals on Riemannian domains
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

{{Integral of a two-form}}

The area of a Riemannian domain is then defined as
$$
\int_M \det
$$
and we can define the integral of an arbitrary $$g \in \smooth^\infty (M)$$ as $$\int_M g\det,$$ both of which are invariant under isometry, in contrast to $$\int_M g.$$
