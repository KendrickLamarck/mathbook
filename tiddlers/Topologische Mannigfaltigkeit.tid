A //topological $$m$$-manifold// is a [[second countable|Second-countable]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff'scher Raum]] $$M=M^m$$ that is locally [[homeomorphic|Hom√∂omorphismus]] to $$\R^m,$$ i.e. for all $$p\in M$$ there exists an open neighborhood $$U\ni p$$ and a homeomorphism $$\varphi\colon U\to\varphi(U)\subseteq\R^m.$$ The pair $$(U,\varphi)$$ is called a //(coordinate) chart// for $$M.$$

A topological manifold $$M$$ is [[locally connected|Locally connected space]], [[locally compact|Locally compact space]], [[normal|Normal topological space]] and [[paracompact|Paracompact space]].

''Remark.''
We sometimes replace "second countable" with "paracompact" in the definition, which is equivalent, except for allowing uncountably many components.
