Let $$\mathbf E\colon \R^3 \supseteq M \to \R^3$$ be a vector field called the //electric field// with the property $$\rot \mathbf{E} = 0$$ and let $$\widetilde{\mathbf E}$$ be the [[corresponding one-form|Bilinearformen und dualit√§t]]. Due to this property there exists a unique //electric potential// $$\phi \in \smooth^\infty(M)$$ with $$\d\phi = -\widetilde{\mathbf{E}}$$ and $$\grad\phi = -\mathbf{E}.$$ In particular, any path integral along $$\gamma\colon [a,b] \to \R^3$$
$$
\int_\gamma \widetilde{\mathbf{E}} = \phi(\gamma(a))-\phi(\gamma(b))
$$
only depends on the start and end points, but not the path itself.

* We call $$\divergence \mathbf E = \rho$$ the //charge// (Gauss' law). Every compactly supported charge distribution has a corresponding potential.
* In absence of a magnetic field, the force exerted on a particle with charge $$q$$ is determined by the Lorentz force law $$\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf E.$$ The electric potential energy of a particle with charge $$q$$ at point $$x$$ is thus $$q\phi(x).$$

The //kinetic energy// is given by
$$
E_\mathrm{kin}(\mathbf{E}) =
\frac{1}{2} \int_{\R^3} \|\mathbf{E}\|^2 =
E_\D(\phi).
$$
The //electrostatic energy// $$E_\rho$$ with respect to a given charge distribution $$\rho$$ is defined as
$$
E_\rho(\phi) = \int_{\R^3} \rho \phi.
$$
In the light of the Lorentz force law, this can be thought of as the total potential energy in the system.

@@.theorem
''Theorem.''
For a charge distribution $$\rho,$$ the critical point $$\phi$$ of $$E = E_\D - E_\rho$$ under compactly supported [[variations|Variation (smooth function)]] is an electric potential of $$\rho,$$ i.e.
$$
\rho = -\divergence\grad\phi = -\Delta\phi.
