title: One-point compactification
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Suppose $$X$$ is a noncompact but locally compact Hausdorff space. Then the //one-point compactification// of $$X$$ is $$\hat{X} \coloneqq X \cup \{\infty\}$$ with the following topology: A subset $$U \subseteq \hat{X}$$ is open if $$U \subseteq X$$ is open or if $$\hat{X} \setminus U \subseteq X$$ is compact.

* As the name implies, this is compact.
* $$\widehat{\R}^n \cong \sphere^n.$$
