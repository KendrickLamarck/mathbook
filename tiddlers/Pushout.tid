Let $$X$$ and $$(Y_k)_{k \in K}$$ be objects together with morphisms $$(i_k\colon X \to Y_k).$$ The //pushout// is an object $$P$$ with morphisms $$(j_k\colon Y_k \to P)$$ such that the following universal property is fulfilled:

For all objects $$Z$$ and all families of morphisms $$(f_k\colon Y_k \to Z)$$ such that $$f_k \circ i_k = f_l \circ i_l$$ for all $$k$$ and $$l,$$ there exists a unique morphism $$f\colon P \to Z$$ such that $$f_k = f \circ j_k$$ for all k.$$
