title: 2D gyrational symmetry
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Let $$\rho_\theta \in \O_2$$ denote the rotation by angle $$\theta.$$ The subgroup generated by the $$n$$-fold $$\rho_{2\pi/n}$$ is a cyclic group isomorphic to $$C_n \cong \Z/n\Z$$ denoted by $$n\bullet$$ ("n point") in Conway's notation. We call this $$n$$-fold gyrational symmetry, where a rotational symmetry without mirror symmetry is a //gyration.//
