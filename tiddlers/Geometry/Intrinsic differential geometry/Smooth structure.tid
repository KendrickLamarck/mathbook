A //$$\mathcal C^r$$-structure// on $$M$$ is a maximal $$\mathcal C^r$$-atlas, i.e. a $$\mathcal C^r$$-atlas $$\mathcal U=\{(U_\alpha,\varphi_\alpha)\}$$ such that any chart $$(V,\psi)$$ that is compatible with all the $$(U_\alpha,\varphi_\alpha)$$ is already contained in $$\mathcal U.$$ For any $$\mathcal C^r$$-atlas there is a unique maximal one containing it.
