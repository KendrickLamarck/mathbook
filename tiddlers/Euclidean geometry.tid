$$\Bbb R^n$$ with the transformation [[group|Gruppe]] of Euclidean motions

$$
x\mapsto Ax+b
$$

with $$A\in \mathrm O(n),\ b\in\Bbb R^n.$$

This is an obvious [[subgeometry|Subgeometry]] of [[similarity geometry|Similarity geometry]]. It can also be obtained in a similar way from [[MÃ¶bius geometry]]: Let $$p\in Q.$$ Consider the projective model and the subgroup of transformations that come from maps $$A\in\mathrm{GL}(n+2)$$ with $$Ap=p$$ and [[project stereographically|Stereographic projection]].
