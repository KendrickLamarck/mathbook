For every planar closed curve $$(\gamma,\tau)$$ there is $$n\in\Z$$ with
$$
\int_0^\tau \kappa \,\d s = 2\pi n.
$$
The number $$n$$ is called the //turning number// of the planar closed curve $$(\gamma,\tau)$$ and is the number of times the tangent vector turns (clockwise or counterclockwise) when traveling the curve once.
