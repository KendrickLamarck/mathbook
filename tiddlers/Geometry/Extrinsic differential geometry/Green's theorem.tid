Let $$\gamma$$ be a positively oriented (i.e. counterclockwise), smooth, non-self-intersecting closed planar curve and let $$D$$ be the region bounded by $$\gamma.$$ If $$L$$ and $$M$$ are functions on an open set containing $$D$$ having continuous partial derivatives, then
$$
\int_\gamma L \,\d x + M \,\d y =
\iint_D \fracpartial{M}{x} - \fracpartial{L}{y} \,\d x \,\d y.
$$
