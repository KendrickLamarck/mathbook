A Riemannian manifold $$M$$ is called //isotropic// at $$p\in M$$ if $$K(\varPi\,)$$ is a constant $$K(p)$$ independent of the two-plane $$\varPi\subset \T_p M.$$

@@.theorem
''Theorem.''
Suppose $$M^m$$ is a connected Riemannian manifold of dimension $$m>2$$ which is isotropic at every point $$p\in M.$$ Then $$M$$ has constant curvature.
