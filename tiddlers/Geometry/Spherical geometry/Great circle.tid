A //great circle (Gro√ükreis)// in $$S^2$$ is the intersection of $$S^2$$ with a 2-dimensional [[subspace|Untervektorraum]] of $$\mathbb R^3,$$ which can be written as 
$$
E=\{\,x\in\mathbb R^3\mid\langle x,a\rangle=0\,\}
$$
where $$a\in S^2.$$

* The points $$\pm a\in S^2$$ are called the //poles// of the great circle $$E\cap S^2.$$

* For $$x,y\in S^2$$ with $$x\ne\pm y$$ there is exactly one great circle through $$x$$ and $$y.$$

* If $$y=-x,$$ there is a 1-parameter family of great circles through $$x$$ and $$y.$$
