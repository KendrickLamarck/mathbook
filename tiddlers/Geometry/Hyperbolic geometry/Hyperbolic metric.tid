The shortes piecewise [[continuously differentiable|Stetige Differenzierbarkeit]] curve connecting two points $$x,y\in H^n$$ is the [[hyperbolic line segment|Hyperbolic line]] between them. This defines a [[metric|Metrik]] $$d$$ on [[hyperbolic space|Hyperbolic geometry]] given by
$$
\cosh d(x,y)=-\langle x,y\rangle.
