A //pointed space// $$(X,x)$$ is a topological space $$X$$ together with a point $$x \in X.$$ A morphism of pointed spaces is a continuous map $$f\colon (X,x) \to (Y,y)$$ such that $$f(x) = y.$$

The path-lifting property in this case reads as follows: Given a based path $$\gamma\colon (I,0) \to (X,x)$$ and a covering $$p\colon (\tilde{X},\tilde{x}) \to (X,x),$$ there exists a unique lift $$\tilde{\gamma}\colon (I,0) \to (\tilde{X},\tilde{x}).$$
