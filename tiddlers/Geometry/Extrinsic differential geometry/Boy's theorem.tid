Let $$f\colon M \to \R^3$$ be a parametrized surface that [[closes up|Closed surface]]. Then the Gaussian curvature $$K$$ of $$f$$ satisfies
$$
\int_M K \det = 2\pi \cdot \chi(M).
$$
If $$(f,\rho,a)$$ is a closed surface with $$m$$ components and [[genus|Genus]] $$g,$$ we get
$$
\int_M K \det = 4\pi(m-g).
$$
