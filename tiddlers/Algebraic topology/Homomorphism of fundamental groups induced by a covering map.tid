title: Homomorphism of fundamental groups induced by a covering map
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If $$p\colon (\overtilde{4}{-3}{X},\tilde{x}) \to (X,x)$$ is a covering map, then $$p_*\colon \pi_1(\overtilde{4}{-3}{X},\tilde{x}) \to \pi_1(X,x)$$ is injective. The image $$H \coloneqq p_* \pi_1(\overtilde{4}{-3}{X},\tilde{x}) < \pi_1(X,x)$$ consists of those loops which lift to loops in $$\overtilde{4}{-3}{X}.$$ If $$\overtilde{4}{-3}{X}$$ is path-connected, then the number of sheets in the covering equals the index of $$H$$ in $$\pi_1(X).$$
