!! Structure/naming

* All and only added system tiddlers have the prefix `$:/_`.
* There should be at least 3 subitems when creating a tag or list. 2 is OK sometimes, 1 is always bad.

!! $$\KaTeX$$

* Variables cursive, e.g. $$\sigma \in \varSigma, x \in X.$$
* Operators roman, e.g. $$\D_p f,\ \d\varphi.$$
* constants as is customary/needed: $$e^x$$ cursive, $$\i$$ roman if e.g. an index $$i$$ is present...

!! Markup style

* Use `\Bbb{P}` and not `\Bbb P` to improve searchability.
* Always explicitly specify a wikilink name, even if it is the same, e.g. `[[Spur|Spur]]` to make renaming with relink fully seamless.

!! Open/unanswerable questions

* Which headers when?
* What should be its own tiddler and what shouldn't?
