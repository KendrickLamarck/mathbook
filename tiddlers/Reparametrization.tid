title: Reparametrization
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A parametrized curve $$\gamma\colon [a,b] \to \R^n$$ is a //reparametrization// of another curve $$\tilde\gamma\colon [\alpha,\beta] \to \R^n,$$ if there is a smooth bijection $$\varphi\colon [a,b] \to [\alpha,\beta]$$ with $$\varphi' \ne 0$$ such that $$\gamma = \tilde\gamma \circ \varphi.$$ A reparametrization is called //orientation-preserving,// if $$\varphi'>0.$$

Reparametrization, as well as orientation-preserving reparametrization, defines an [[equivalence relation|Ã„quivalenzrelation]] on the set of parametrized curves.
