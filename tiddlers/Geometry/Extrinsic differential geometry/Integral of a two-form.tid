title: Integral of a two-form
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The integral of a [[2-form|Differential form]] $$\sigma$$ on a compact, connected domain $$M \subset \R^2$$ with smooth boundary is defined as
$$
\int_M \sigma \coloneqq \int_M \sigma(U,V),
$$
where $$U(p) = (p,(1,0))$$ and $$V(p) = (p,(0,1))$$ are the standard coordinate vector fields.
