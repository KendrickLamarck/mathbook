title: Free elastic curve
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

{{Bending energy}} A parametrized curve is said to be //freely elastic,// if for all variations with compact support it satisfies $$\dot E = 0.$$

* <div>An arc length parametrized curve is freely elastic if and only if
$$
\kappa'' + \tfrac 1 2 \kappa^3 = 0.
$$
This uniquely defines the freely elastic curve in the plane up to similarity.</div>

* Use $$b$$ from the more general condition for [[elastic curves|Elastic curve]]. Then the inflection points of a freely elastic curve $$\gamma$$ lie on the line $$g$$ through $$b$$ and $$\gamma$$ intersects $$g$$ perpendicularly in those points.

* If $$\gamma(t_0)$$ is a [[vertex|Vertex (curve)]], then $$g$$ is tangent to the osculating circle at $$\gamma(t_0).$$
