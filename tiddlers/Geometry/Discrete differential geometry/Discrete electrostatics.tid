Let $$\rho \in \mathscr{M}(M)$$ be a given //charge distribution.// We can then define the //electrostatic energy// of a potential $$\phi \in \mathscr{C}(M)$$ as in the smooth case by
$$
E_\rho(\phi) = \int_M \phi \rho.
$$

''Theorem.''
Let $$L\colon \mathscr{C}(M) \to \mathscr{M}(M)$$ be the [[symmetric operator|Bilinearformen und dualit√§t]] such that
$$
E_\D(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} \int_M \phi(L\phi),
$$
see [[Discrete Dirichlet energy]]. Then

# $$\phi$$ is a critical point of $$E = E_\D - E_\rho$$ if and only if $$L\phi = \rho.$$
# The //Poisson problem// $$L\phi = \rho$$ has a solution if and only if $$\int_M \rho = 0.$$ If there is a solution, it is unique up to an added constant.
