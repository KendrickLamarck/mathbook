title: Integral of a 2-form
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The integral of a [[2-form|Differential form]] $$\sigma$$ on a compact connected domain with smooth boundary $$M \subset \R^2$$ is defined as
$$
\int_M \sigma \coloneqq \int_M \sigma(U,V),
$$
where $$U(p) = (p,(1,0))$$ and $$V(p) = (p,(0,1))$$ are the standard coordinate vector fields.
