title: Projective transformations between lines
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Let $$l_1,l_2$$ be two different [[lines|Projective line]] in a [[projective plane|Projective subspace]] $$P(V).$$ A projective transformation $$l_1\to l_2$$ is a [[central projection|Central projection]] if and only if it maps the intersection $$l_1\cap l_2$$ to itself. Otherwise it is the composition of two central projections $$l_1\to l\to l_2.$$
