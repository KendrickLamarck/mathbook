Given $$A \subseteq X,$$ a retraction of $$X$$ onto $$A$$ is a map $$r\colon X \to A$$ whose restriction to $$A$$ is the identity.

This can be viewed as the topological analogue of a [[projection|Projektion]]: Any map $$r\colon X \to X$$ with $$r \circ r = r$$ is a retraction when viewed as a map onto its image.

@@.theorem
''Proposition.''
Let $$r\colon X \to A$$ be a retraction and $$i\colon A \hookrightarrow X$$ be the inclusion map. Choose any $$a \in A$$ as the base point for $$A$$ and $$X.$$ Then the induced map $$r_*$$ on the fundamental groups is surjective, while $$i_*$$ is injective.

''Corollary.''
There is no retraction from $$D^2$$ onto its boundary $$\sphere^1 = \partial D^2.$$ In fact, this is true in arbitrary dimension.

''Proposition.''
The [[induced map|Chain map]] on homology $$r_*\colon H_n(X) \to H_n(A)$$ is surjective for each $$n.$$
