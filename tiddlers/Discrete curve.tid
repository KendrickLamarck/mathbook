An //open discrete curve// is a finite sequence $$\gamma\colon \{0,\dots,n-1\} \to \R^3.$$ A //closed discrete curve// (with $$n$$ vertices) is a map $$\gamma\colon \Z/n\Z \to \R^3,$$ i.e. an $$n$$-periodic map from $$\Z$$ to $$\R^3.$$

We denote the vertices of the curve by $$\gamma_i$$ and define the //edge vectors// $$\mathbf e_i \coloneqq \gamma_{i+1}-\gamma_i$$ of //edge length// $$\ell_i \coloneqq \|\mathbf e_i\|.$$ How many edge vectors there are depends on if the curve is open or closed.
