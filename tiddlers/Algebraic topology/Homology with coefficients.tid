Fix an abelian group $$G$$ and let $$C_n(X;G) \coloneqq C_n(X) \otimes G$$ be the set of formal sums of simplices with coefficients in $$G.$$ Using the same formula for the boundary map (formally), we get a chain complex $$C_*(X;G).$$ For a pair $$(X,A),$$ we set $$C_*(X,A;G) \coloneqq C_*(X;G)/C_*(A;G).$$ The homology of these chain complexes $$H_n(X;G)$$ and $$H_n(X,A;G)$$ are //homology with coefficients in $$G.$$// Reduced homology comes from the obvious [[augmentation map|Reduced homology]] $$\varepsilon\colon C_0(X;G) \to G.$$
To contrast, the ordinary homology $$H_n(X) = H_n(X;\Z)$$ is called //integral homology.// Homology with coefficients in any $$G$$ is already determined by integral homology.

{{Betti number}} We get:

* $$H_n(X;\Q) = H_n(X) \otimes \Q = \Q^r$$ and the same is true for $$\R$$ and any other field with [[characteristic|Charakteristik]] 0.
* $$H_n(X;\Z_p)$$ is a vector space of dimension $$r$$ plus the number of torsion coefficients of $$H_n(X)$$ and $$H_{n-1}(X)$$ with $$p_i = p.$$

In so-called //mod-2 homology// with $$G = \Z_2$$ we ignore orientation. Chains can be understood as finite collections of simplices with addition being set difference. The mod-2 homology of $$\RP^n$$ is
$$
H_k(\RP^n;\Z^2) \cong \begin{cases}
  \Z_2, & 0 \le k \le n, \\
  0,    & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$
