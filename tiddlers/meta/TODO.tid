{{Reminder}}

!! Issues

* Migrate this TODO to the github issues

* Structure changes
** Organize plane curves (distinct from space curves?)
** Exterior algebra: Linear algebra, Algebra or differential geometry?
** Distinguish the different types of normal fields / normal vectors etc. better
** Change some names (with parentheses) maybe, now that it's possible with relink

* We don't want to commit changes where only the //modified// field has changed.

* A lot of paragraphs are wrong

!! Content ideas

* Examples, in particular statistics, particular distributions, estimators and so on
* Wof√ºr sind die [[Verteilungen|Verteilung]] gut?

* Add sources (as embedded PDFs?)
** Copyright / ethical issues, some stuff wasn't meant to be published. Just use those which are freely accessible on the web

!! Tech ideas

* Hosting a node wiki on the web would be great
* Styling definitions, theorems, etc. with classes

* replacing particular $$\KaTeX$$ code with macros that reflect the use (an example would be `\smooth`) would be great to reduce manual edits in the future.
** `\differential{f}{p}` to toggle between $$\D_p f$$ and $$\D f(p).$$
** avoid single letters

* Try applying the 5-color subpalettes to the Solarized palettes
* Filter field & "open all" button in $:/_templates/tree

* Commutative diagrams as images (for now)
** Partially solved. TeX w/ `\documentclass{standalone}`, convert with pdf2svg and see [[Pushout]] for an example.
** What could be better: Color, direct svg generating from within TeX.

!! (Future) collaboration

* More line breaks so it's easier to see what was changed in a commit
* Translate everything to English to improve accessibility?
* Comments that only editors can see. Who is an editor? [[$:/status/UserName]] is present / not empty? &rarr; reveal widget
