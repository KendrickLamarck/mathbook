type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Suppose $$\nabla$$ is a [[connection|Connection]] on some [[vector bundle|Vector bundle]] $$E\to M.$$ If $$\gamma\colon I\to M$$ is a curve from $$p$$ to $$q$$ and $$\sigma$$ is a section of $$E$$, then we write (conflating $$\sigma$$ and $$\sigma\circ\gamma$$) the //covariant derivative// of $$\sigma$$ along $$\gamma$$ as

$$
\frac{\D}{\d t}\sigma\coloneqq\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\sigma.
