Up to conjugacy in the affine group $$\operatorname{Aff}(\Bbb E^1),$$ there are two discrete subgroups of $$E_1$$: the infinite cyclic group $$\Z$$ of integer translations and the infinite dihedral group $$D_\infty=\Z \rtimes \{\pm 1\}$$ also including reflections across half integers. We call these groups $$\infty\bullet$$ and $$*\infty\bullet,$$ respectively.
