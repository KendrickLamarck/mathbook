$$\Bbb R^n$$ with the transformation [[group|Gruppe]] of Euclidean motions
$$
x\mapsto Ax+b
$$
with $$A\in \mathrm O(n),\ b\in\Bbb R^n.$$

!! From Möbius geometry

This is an obvious [[subgeometry|Subgeometry]] of [[similarity geometry|Similarity geometry]]. It can also be obtained in a similar way from $$n$$-dimensional [[Möbius geometry]]: Let $$p\in Q\subset\RP^{n+1}$$ (most obviously the north pole of $$\sphere^n$$). Consider the projective model and the subgroup of transformations that come from maps $$A\in\PO(n+1,1)$$ with $$Ap=p.$$ Then [[project stereographically|Stereographic projection]] from $$p$$.

!! From Laguerre geometry

We obtain euclidean geometry if we consider the [[Laguerre transformations|Laguerre geometry]] that map point spheres to point spheres.
