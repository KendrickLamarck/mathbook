Let $$f\colon M \to \R^3$$ be a surface with unit normal $$N$$ and with outward pointing normal field $$B$$ along the boundary $$\partial M.$$ let $$f_t$$ be a variation of $$f$$ with variational vector field
$$
\dot{f} = \phi N + \d f(Z)
$$
where $$\phi \in \smooth^\infty(M)$$ and $$Z \in \vecfields(M).$$ Then
$$\begin{aligned}
\left.\fracderiv{}{t}\right|_{t=0} \mathcal{W}(f_t) =
&\phantom{+}\int_M \phi(\Delta H + 2H(H^2-K))\det \\ &+
\int_{\partial M} \lang B,H^2 Z-H\grad\phi+\phi\grad H \rang\,\d s,
\end{aligned}$$
where $$\d s$$ implies arc length parametrization of the boundary.
