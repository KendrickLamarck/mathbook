Let $$(X_i)_{i \in I}$$ be a family of objects. A //product// of this family is an object $$X$$ together with a family of morphisms $$(\pi_i\colon X \to X_i)_{i \in I}$$ such that the following universal property is fulfilled:

For every object $$Y$$ and every family of morphisms $$(f_i\colon Y \to X_i)_{i \in I},$$ there exists a unique morphism $$f\colon Y \to X$$ such that $$f_i = \pi_i \circ f$$ for all $$i \in I.$$ We then write $$X \eqqcolon \prod X_i.$$
