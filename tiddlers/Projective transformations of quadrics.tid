If the [[signature|Signatur]] is not neutral, then any [[projective transformation|Projective transformation]] that maps a [[quadric|Projective quadric]] $$Q$$ to itself comes from a linear map which is orthogonal with respect to the defining non-degenerate [[symmetric|Symmetrische Form]] [[bilinear form|Bilinearform]] $$q.$$
