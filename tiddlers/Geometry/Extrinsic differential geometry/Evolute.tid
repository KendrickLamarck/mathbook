The //evolute// of a regular curve $$\gamma$$ is the curve on which the center of the [[osculating circle|Osculating circle]] moves. It is also the curve [[enveloped|Projective lines enveloping a curve]] by the normals (i.e. the lines spanned by the normal vectors) of $$\gamma.$$ The evolute is given by

$$
\gamma - \frac{1}{\kappa}N.
