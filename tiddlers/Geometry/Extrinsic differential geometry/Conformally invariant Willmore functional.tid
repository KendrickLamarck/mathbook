title: Conformally invariant Willmore functional
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Let $$f\colon M \to \R^3$$ be a parametrized surface with principal curvatures $$\kappa_1$$ and $$\kappa_2.$$ The //conformally invariant Willmore functional// is defined as
$$
\overset{\sim}{\mathcal{W}}(f) \coloneqq
\frac{1}{4} \int_M (\kappa_1 - \kappa_2)^2\det =
\int_M (H^2 - K) \det.
$$
Critical points of this are surfaces that are "as spherical as possible" while remaining fixed at the boundary. Compare also the [[umbilic point theorem|Umbilic point]].

This functional is MÃ¶bius-invariant.
