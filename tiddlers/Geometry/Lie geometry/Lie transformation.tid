A //Lie transformation// is a transformation on the set of [[Lie spheres|Lie sphere]] that corresponds to a [[projective transformation|Projective transformation]] of $$\RP^{n+2}$$ that map the [[Lie quadric]] to itself. The [[group|Gruppe]] of Lie transformations is $$\PO(n+1,2).$$

Lie transformations preserve oriented contact and any bijective transformation of the space of oriented spheres which maps spheres in oriented contact to spheres in oriented contact is a Lie transformation.
