title: Integral curve

Given a [[vector field|Vektorfeld]] on a manifold $$M,$$ a curve $$\gamma\colon J\to M$$ (where $$J\subseteq\R$$ is some open interval) is called an //integral curve// of $$X$$ if $$\gamma'(t)=X_{\gamma(t)}$$ for all $$t\in J.$$

Since any $$\R$$-action $$\theta$$ has an infinitesimal generator $$X,$$ each orbit $$\gamma_p(t)=\theta_t(p)$$ is an integral curve of $$X,$$ defined on $$J=\R.$$
