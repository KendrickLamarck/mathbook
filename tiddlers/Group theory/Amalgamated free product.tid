title: Amalgamated free product
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Let $$F,G,H$$ be groups with homomorphisms (sometimes required to be injective, so we can think of $$F$$ as a common subgroup) $$i_G\colon F\to G,\ i_H\colon F \to H.$$ Then the //amalgamated free product// $$G \star_F H$$ is the quotient $$(G \star H)/N,$$ where $$N \lhd G \star H$$ is the normal subgroup generated by all elements of the form $$i_G(f)i_H(f)^{-1}.$$

The //amalgamated free product// is the [[pushout|Pushout]] in the category of groups.
