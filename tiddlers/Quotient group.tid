title: Quotient group
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If $$N \lhd G$$ is a [[normal subgroup|Conjugation]], we can define the //quotient group// $$Q = G/N.$$ Its elements are the [[cosets|Coset]] of $$N$$ and the group operation is $$(Ng)(Ng') \coloneqq N(gg').$$

* The //quotient map// $$\pi\colon G \to Q,\ g \mapsto Ng$$ has kernel $$N.$$
* We say $$G$$ is an //extension// of $$Q$$ by $$N.$$
