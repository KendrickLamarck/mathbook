If $$\mu$$ is any reflection, the group generated by $$\mu$$ and $$n\bullet$$ is a semidirect product isomorphic to the [[dihedral group|Dihedral group]] $$D_n.$$ This is the symmetry group of a regular $$n$$-gon in the plane; we denote it by $$*n\bullet$$ ("star n point"). We define these only up to conjugacy, because for a different choice of $$\mu,$$ they are just the symmetry groups of the same object rotated.

For odd $$n,$$ all reflections are conjugate to each other, but for even $$n,$$ they form two conjugacy classes. Consider for example, the symmetry lines through the edges and vertices of a square.
