title: Statistical distance

A //statistical distance// or //divergence// $$d(\cdot\mmid\cdot)$$ is an informal distance measure between probability measures or other objects like [[markov kernels|Ãœbergangskern]]. It is usually required to fulfill $$d(\mu \mmid \nu) = 0 \iff \mu = \nu.$$ If it is a metric, we write it as $$d(\cdot, \cdot)$$ instead.
