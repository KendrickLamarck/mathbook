For any four points $$A,B,C,D\in\Bbb R\mathrm P^1$$ there is a unique [[projective transformation|Projective transformation]] $$f\colon\Bbb R\mathrm P^1\to \Bbb R\mathrm P^1$$ with $$f(A)=B,f(B)=A,f(C)=D,f(D)=C.$$ The transformation $$f$$ is an [[involution|Involution]].

* The involution $$f$$ has no fixed points if $$\{A,B\}$$ [[separates|Separation on the real projective line]] $$\{C,D\},$$ otherwise it has two fixed points.

* If $$f$$ has two fixed points $$P$$ and $$Q,$$ then $$\{X,f(X)\}$$ separates $$\{P,Q\}$$ [[harmonically|Harmonic position]] for all $$X\in\Bbb R\mathrm P^1.$$
