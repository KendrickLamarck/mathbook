title: Oriented manifold

{{Volume form}} We say a manifold $$M$$ is //orientable// if it admits a [[volume form|Volume form]]. An //orientation// of $$M$$ is a choice of volume form up to pointwise multiplication by positive smooth functions $$\lambda\in\mathcal C^\infty M.$$ The standard orientation is given by $$\d x_1\wedge\dots\wedge\d x_m,$$ so that $$\{e_1,\dots,e_m\}$$ is an oriented basis for each $$\T_p M.$$

An equivalent definition is through a coherently oriented atlas for $$M$$: Two charts $$(U,\varphi)$$ and $$(V,\psi)$$ are //coherently oriented//, if the transition function $$\varphi\circ\psi^{-1}$$ is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of $$\R^m.$$
