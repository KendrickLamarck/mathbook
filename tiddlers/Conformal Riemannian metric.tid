title: Conformal Riemannian metric

A [[Riemannian metric]] on an open subset $$U\subseteq\R^n$$ is called //conformal// if

$$
g_p(u,v)=\lambda(p)\langle u,v\rangle_{\Bbb R^n}
$$

for some function $$\lambda\colon\Bbb R^n\to\Bbb R_{>0}.$$ In this case, angles measured using $$g$$ are equal to the euclidean angles.
